                <br />
                Welcome, and thank you for stopping by &ndash;You are in the right place if you&#39;re looking for a multimedia graphic designer who is passionate, experienced, and consistently produces quality results.<br />
                <br />
                I have had the pleasure of designing products ranging from the military to scientific and educational content. I&#39;ve kept myself relevant by freelancing different types of work such as infographics, package and label design, logo and identity design, art, illustration, etc. This also taught me to design for diverse audiences, from children&#39;s, sports, culinary, edgy modern, and more business-oriented. In other words, I am constantly sharpening my creative skills.<br />
                <br />
                I have vast experience working with (GPO) the Federal Government Printing Office, and commercial printers, ensuring that every client submission meets high printing standards. I currently work as a Multimedia Specialist creating graphics, videos, and publications, and I am the official photographer for the Perry Center at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C.<br />
                <br />
                I have over 20+ years of Agency, corporate, government, private sector, and freelance design experience. It goes without saying that I&#39;ve worn many hats, such as Illustrator, video editor, visual designer, production artist, branding, photographer, Marketing, and many more. By the way, I am honest, friendly, motivated, responsible, team-oriented, hardworking, and very creative!&nbsp;<br />
                <br />
                As a Creative, my passion for raffin&eacute; et r&eacute;utilis&eacute; comes from the love of upcycling, repurposing, and fashion. I like to experiment with colors, type fonts, shapes, and textures. I sometimes take inspiration from nature, but mostly from pure imagination. There are times when inspiration strikes me while going for a walk, sitting in silence, meditating, or even in the middle of an artistic experiment.<br />
                <br />
                My pursuit of aesthetic refinement led me to become a Multimedia specialist for the government. &quot;I know&quot; is not quite the same but stay tuned; my story is not over.</span></p>
